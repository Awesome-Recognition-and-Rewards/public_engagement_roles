# Getting started

## Deploying

This template tries to take away as much manual labor as possible. The idea is that the website is updated everytime something changes on the `main` branch. This way you can focus on writing great content!


```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>
cd <repo>

# set up the publishing to github pages
quarto publish gh-pages
```

If you like commandlines and need to install Quarto, [check out the Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/index.html) for more info.
